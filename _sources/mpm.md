# Material Point Method
Material Point Method (MPM) is a particle based method that represents the material as a collection of material points, and their deformations are determined by Newtonâ€™s laws of motion. 
The MPM is a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian approach, which uses moving material points and computational nodes on a background mesh.
This approach is very effective particularly in the context of large deformations.

Arrows represent material point state vectors (mass, volume, velocity, etc.) being projected to the nodes of the computational grid. 
(2) The equations of motion are solved onto the nodes, resulting in updated nodal velocities and positions. 
(3) The updated nodal kinematics are interpolated back to the material points. 
(4) The state of the material points is updated, and the
computational grid is reset

## Conservation properties
MPM automatically satisfies the mass conservation by assigning a constant mass to each material point. 
The momentum balance is enforced in governing equations. 
However, Bardenhagen (2002) showed that the original MPM formulation does not satisfy the energy conservation explicitly. 
It was found that the energy conservation in MPM is strongly
dependent on the two algorithms which are used to update the stress at material points.
